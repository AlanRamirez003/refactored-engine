	<p> Lions <p/>
	 <p>Not only are male lions generally larger than females, but they also have a distinctive thick mane of hair around their heads that females lack. The biggest and most fabulous manes are more impressive to mating females and more intimidating to competing males, according to the San Diego Zoo. The mane also protects the male's neck during fights over territory or mating rights. African lions tend to have bigger, more magnificent manes compared to their Asiatic cousins.</p>

	 <p> Elephants <p/>
	 <p>Elephants eat a wide range of plant material, including grass, leaves, woody parts of trees and shrubs, flowers and fruits when available. After rain, they will dig for roots. Asian elephants feed on more than 100 species of plant, and both African and Asian elephants take crops such as millet. An adult needs to eat up to 150kg of food a day – that’s 50 tonnes a year!</p>

	<p> Rhinos <p/>
	 <p>Rhino horn poaching is the main threat facing rhinos as demand has escalated in Asian countries, especially in Vietnam. Despite having no proven medicinal value and made of keratin, rhino horn has long been used in traditional medicines but in recent years, it has been incorrectly touted as a cure for ailments ranging from hangovers to treatment for cancer as well as status symbol.</p>

	 <p> Giraffes <p/>
	 <p>Giraffes are the world’s tallest land mammals, reaching up to 19 feet tall. Their long necks help them eat fruit and leaves from tall trees that most animals are too short to reach. However, giraffes are experiencing a devastating population decline. Their numbers have dropped by 40% over the past 30 years. Human activity including deforestation, agriculture, violence, and industry has destroyed giraffe habitat, and poaching has been on the rise. Over the past decade alone, the U.S. imported over 39,000 giraffe parts, the equivalent of over 3,700 giraffes.</p>

	 <p> Hippopotamus <p/>
	 <p>They leave the water pool at night to graze for four to five hours, covering up to eight kilometers (five miles) of territory. They will eat about 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of food during this time. Their modest appetite is due to its sedentary life, which does not require high outputs of energy. When returning from grazing before dawn, they will enter their water pool at the same spot they exited.</p>
